# Repo Impostor

**Repo Impostor** is a BepInEx mod for REPO that introduces social deception mechanics inspired by *Among Us*. Players are randomly assigned the role of an Impostor, deceiving and eliminating others ‚Äî all while trying not to get caught.

This is a mod made to be played with a friend group with honor system. Some easy rules are:

1. No respawning - Do not respawn the dead players as they know too much
2. Impostors win if they destroy enough valuables so the Taxman fails the team, or kill all the crewmates
